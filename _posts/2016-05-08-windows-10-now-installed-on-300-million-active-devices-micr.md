# Windows 10 Now Installed On 300 Million Active Devices: Microsoft Reminds Users Free Upgrade Ends July 29

Through a post on the official Windows blog, Microsoft's Corporate VP for Windows and Devices Group Yusuf Mehdi announced that the company's latest operating system, Windows 10, has reached the milestone of being installed on 300 million active devices.

The achievement comes just as Windows 10 nears its launch anniversary, and after recent news that the operating system [held][0] a 14.35 percent market share among all computers by the end of April.

In the post, Mehdi also noted several pieces of information that showed how users are adopting Windows 10 faster, as well as using it more.

In the month of March, it was [revealed][1] that users spent more than 63 billion minutes on the operating system's Edge browser, which represents a 50 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Cortana, Windows 10's digital personal assistant, has answered more than 6 billion questions since it was launched, and during the same time frame, users have played over 9 billion hours of video games on the operating system.

It was also reported that apps which come along with Windows 10 are posting active user figures of millions per month, with Photos drawing over 144 million people monthly. The Windows Store is also continuing to grow, with new apps developed for the Universal Windows platform, updates to such apps and new games being added to the online store.

Mehdi, however, noted that the free upgrade offer to current Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users is rapidly reaching its end. The offer will last only until July 29, which is less than three months away, and so users that are still thinking of whether to upgrade or not to Windows 10 will have to decide soon.

After the free upgrade offer is finished, Windows 10 could be obtained by purchasing a new device or by buying Windows 10 Home, which will have a price tag of $179\.

The growth of Windows 10 slowed down in April, as it only gained a 0.20 percent increase in market share from 14.15 percent in March. However, for the first time since the release of Windows 10, the market share of Windows 7 has fallen below majority. From an over 60 percent market share before the launch of the new operating system, Windows 7 now only holds 49.79 percent of the market at the end of April.
